files for Data Boot Camp Module 21 Deep Learning Challenge

## Challenge Overview 

In this challenge I applied a deep neural network (DNN) to data from foundation Alphabet Soup to help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their business ventures. The goal was to optimize the model to achieve higher than 75% accuracy in prediciting if a loan from Alphabet Soup would be successful.

See `Applicant_Success_Analysis` for full details and results.
